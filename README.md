## installed software
+ interface
  + **bspwm** _window manager_  chosen because it's easily configured and doesn't get in the way of productivity.
  + **sxhxd** _hotkey daemon_  default for bspwm and I have no reason to change it.
  + **urxvt** _terminal emulator_  lightweight, extensible with perl, few compatibility issues / quirks.
  + **feh** _image viewer and background setter_  it's simple and does everything you need.
  + **unclutter** _X cursor hider_  this is a mostly keyboard driven config, the cursor is useless most of the time.
  + **redshift** _screen temperature daemon_  reduces eye strain in reduced light.
+ internet

  + **pacaur** _aur helper_  yaort is for losers

This configuration is used with a 2560*1440 13 inch screen, so some things are blown up a bit so I can actually see them.  HighDPI support is almost nonexistant so if you try to use this on a regular screen it might look pretty silly.  Locations are as they appear in my home directory, your mileage may vary.  Obviously change all references of 'artyom' to your user name.  I'll be changing as many references of "/home/artyom" to $HOME as I can later.

To do: write instructions for installing rice
