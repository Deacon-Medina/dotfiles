## installed software
+ Interface
  + **bspwm** window manager.  chosen because it's easily configured and doesn't get in the way of productivity.
  + **sxhxd** hotkey daemon.  default for bspwm and I have no reason to change it.
  + **urxvt** terminal emulator.  lightweight, extensible with perl, few compatibility issues / quirks.
  + **feh** image viewer and background setter.  it's simple and does everything you need.
  + **unclutter** X cursor hider.  this is a mostly keyboard driven config, the cursor is useless most of the time.
  + **redshift** screen temperature daemon.  reduces eye strain in reduced light.

This configuration is used with a 2560*1440 13 inch screen, so some things are blown up a bit so I can actually see them.  HighDPI support is almost nonexistant so if you try to use this on a regular screen it might look pretty silly.  Locations are as they appear in my home directory, your mileage may vary.  Obviously change all references of 'artyom' to your user name.  I'll be changing as many references of "/home/artyom" to $HOME as I can later.

To do: write instructions for installing rice
