This configuration is used with a 2560*1440 13 inch screen, so some things are blown up a bit so I can actually see them.  HighDPI support is almost nonexistant so if you try to use this on a regular screen it might look pretty silly.  Locations are as they appear in my home directory, your mileage may vary.  Obviously change all references of 'artyom' to your user name.  I'll be changing as many references of "/home/artyom" to $HOME as I can later.

To do: write instructions for installing rice
